This project aims to understand the concept of free fall and discuss this motion in the quantum universe. 
We, as a team of three, study “Classical/Quantum Dynamics in a Uniform Gravitational Field: A. 
Unobstructed Free Fall” by Nicholas Wheeler from Reed College Physics Department 
(August, 2002). This report summarizes the idea of free fall action and discusses several 
methods such as Hamiltonian and Lagrangian to solve complex problems in a simpler way. 
Since our project is based on discussing and studying this specific article in our weekly 
meeting with Professor Durmuş Ali Demir, we try to summarize what we understand while 
working on this topic and aim to explain the topic in a compact way by giving important 
calculations and plots from the article. 

Keywords: quantum, modern physics, free fall, mechanics.
